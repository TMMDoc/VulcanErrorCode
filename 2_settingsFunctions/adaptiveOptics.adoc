== TRUMPF Varimode

Vulcan supports the Varimode of Trumpf lasers. TRUMPF Varimode is a feature of TRUMPF lasers that allows for dynamic adjustment of the laser beam's mode. This capability enables the laser to switch between different beam profiles, optimizing the laser's performance for various cutting and welding applications. By adjusting the beam mode, the laser can achieve better quality cuts, increased processing speeds, and improved overall efficiency.

== Adaptive Optics

Adaptive optics option is used for adjusting the Focal distance using the special mirror. the focal distance is controlled by the Air pressure which makes the mirror concave and convex based on the pressure.

A look-up table is generated based on the Radius of Curvature (ROC) vs Focus distance

The function is activated in the technology tables
