== _3.7.1 MK_AXIS_MODAL_VELOCITY_

It is the maximum speed for manual operation (jog keys) of the individual axes. The specified value is limited to MK_AXIS_VELOCITY.

== _3.7.2 MK_AXIS_VELOCITY_

It is the maximum permitted speed of the individual axes in [m/min] or [RPM]. This corresponds to the rapid movement speed of the axes in the straight cut mode. If possible, the movement speed in path operation is also limited by the controller, so that the maximum speed of the individual axes is not exceeded.

== _3.7.3 MK_AXIS_ACCELERATION_

It defines the maximum acceleration and braking ramps for the individual axes in [m /s2] or [1/s2]. In path operation, the path ramps are limited in relation to the component involvement of the individual axes.

== _3.7.4 MK_AXIS_DECELERATION_

It defines the maximum braking ramps for the individual axes in [m /s2] or [1/s2]. In path operation, the path ramps are limited in relation to the component involvement of the individual axes.

== _3.7.5 MK_AXIS_RAMP_TIME_


It is the time in milliseconds, in which the maximum ramps configured in *MK_AXIS_ACCELERATION and MK_AXIS_DECELERATION* for manual operation and straight cut mode operation should be reached. This MC is for setting of acceleration and braking ramps of the individual axes.
