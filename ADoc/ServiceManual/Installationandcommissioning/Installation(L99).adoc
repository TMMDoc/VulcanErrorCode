== Safety inspection

* Inspection instructions for safety equipment acceptance drawing no. 93630-7-120.
* The safety equipment acceptance includes both test points which must be carried out *before the machine is connect- ed to the mains voltage* and test points which must only be carried out after the second start-up!
Perform safety relevant acceptance in accordance with the inspection instructions.

== Switching on the machine for the first time

Check the machine before
switching on
[arabic, start=2]
. Make sure all cables including ground cables are connected correctly.
. Check all gas connections for correct attachment of hoses and correct pressure.
. Check the check list in the folder for TRUMPF service engineers for machine acceptance.
Switch on the machine
for the first time
[arabic, start=5]
. Carry out safety checks in accordance with the specification in the folder for TRUMPF service engineers.
. Switch on the main switch of the machine.
. Check the phase sequence (direction of rotation) of individualmotors by external rotary field gauge or actuating the corres-ponding switch element.
* Once the first direction of rotation (e.g., the chiller) is correct, the other directions of rotation are generally also correct.
[arabic, start=8]
. Turn on the switch of the laser.
