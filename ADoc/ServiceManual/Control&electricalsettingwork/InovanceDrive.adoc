Charge
(bus voltage indicator)
Used to indicate that the bus capacitor carries electric charge.
When this indicator lights up, electric charge may be still present in the internal capacitor of the servo drive even if the main circuit power supply if cut off.
Do not touch the power terminals when this indicator lights up.

image:img/image665.png[img/image665,width=132,height=19] Click to install the commissioning software “InoDriverShop”.

Commissioning software
“InoDriverShop” can be used to do the commissioning and operation for the servo drive (e.g., parameter setting).
It records only the single-turn position.
Descriptions for the
Incremental Encoder
System (X)
* No battery needed, no battery fault or multi-turn fault.
It records not only the single-turn position, but also the number of revolutions.
Descriptions for the
Absolute Encoder System
* Battery needed, indications of battery fault E730.0, multi-turncounting error and overflow fault available.
* When the servo drive is powered off, the encoder performs data backup using the power supplied by the battery. The servo drive therefore can calculate the absolute mechanical position through the encoder after power-on.
