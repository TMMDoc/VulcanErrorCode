== Description
G2/G distance between starting and destination center points 
is implausible with regard to the other entries

== Cause
The arc is programmed inaccurately. The radius of the arc at the starting point differs from the radius at the target point.

== Action
There are two possible solutions, either:
 Program circular arc correctly in CAD/CAM system, or
 increase the tolerance to the programmed inaccuracy (see machine constant MK_CFG_POSITION_TOLERANCE_MM , old notation: MK_EPSILONMM)

== Effect
