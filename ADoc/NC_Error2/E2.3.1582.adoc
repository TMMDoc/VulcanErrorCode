== Description
G23 The configured maximum speed of the virtual axis (E)
 exceeds the defined limit of the distance controlled axis

== Cause
The error occurs if parameter E (virtual control) has been programmed on the G231. The maximum speed of the virtual axis must not be higher than 80 % of the maximum speed of the height-controlled axis so that the controller has sufficient control reserve for the height control.

== Action
Change the machine constant MK_VMAX so that the maximum speed of the virtual axis is at most 80 % of the maximum speed of the height-controlled axis.ExampleError message:
