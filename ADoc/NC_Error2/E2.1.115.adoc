== Description
CAN-Drive: Configured CAN-Bus-Interface is not available

== Cause

 Configuration error: The used controller only has two CAN interfaces, a node ID was configured in MK_CANDRIVES, that refers to CAN3 or CAN4
 Insufficient activation code: a node ID was configured in MK_CANDRIVES that refers to a CAN bus that is physically available, but that is locked via the activation code
 Hardware defect: the expansion board of the EXC66H13 could not be found.

== Action

 Map CAN axes only to interfaces that are available and that are not locked by the activation code (Caution: Please note the fixed mapping of CAN node IDs to the CAN buses of the controller)
 In case of a hardware defect return the device to the manufacturer.

== Effect
