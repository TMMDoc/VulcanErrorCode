A CAN device that was already present on the bus and at least in the PreOperational state has sent a new boot-up message.

== Action
Determine what caused the device to restart. It is possible, for example, that there was a brief power supply loss to the device or that there was a software error in the device. It is also possible that the restart was explicitly requested by the PLC application.
