== Description
EtherCAT: Unknown or unsupported device type found

== Cause
An EtherCAT device configured as an axis is not a supported drive controller.

== Action

 Only use drive controllers approved by Eckelmann as CNC or motion axes.
 Check the EtherCAT configuration in the machine constants. Are the specified addresses correct?
 With topological addressing the logical EtherCAT address 1 is reserved for the internal bus coupler of the EXC89. The first device after EXC89 is addressed via the second index in MK_DRV_ETHERCAT_AXES / MK_ETHERCATDRIVES. Especially this has to be considered if you want to migrate from another controller type to the EXC89 (or vice versa).

== Effect
