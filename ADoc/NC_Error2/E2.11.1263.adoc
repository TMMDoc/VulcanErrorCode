== Description
CANdrive: A node floods the CAN-bus with emergency messages

== Cause
Certain errors occur more than once. This behavior floods the CAN bus. This is a consequential error.

== Action
Evaluate the additional error information (in the example "node 1 error 3210") to identify the CAN node and the error number.
 Eliminate the determined error at the CAN device.
 In many cases, only a hardware reset of the CAN device will help after the original error has been eliminated.

== Effect
