== Description
G2/G start-destination distance > (Radius + dRadius)

== Cause

 Wrong radius or wrong target point programmed
 Rounding error and MK_EPSILONMM = 0
 Start position was changed (e.g. by an interrupt program)

== Action

 Make sure that the start and target points are located actually on an arc of the programmed radius.
 Raise MK_EPSILONMM to a value >0.
 Make sure that interrupt programs leave all axis positions as they were before.  CAUTION: Not only the movement of axes changes the axis positions. Also the (G161) function for actual position transfer provides a minimal change of the axis positions, which can lead to this error without countermeasure (move to the initially found position at the end of the interrupt program).
