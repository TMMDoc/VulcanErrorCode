= General safety information

Many service activities can be dangerous.
Fundamental safety information and conduct guidelines are presented below and are not listed again separately in the instructions.
Generally speaking:
* Comply with the Safety chapter of the operator's manual.
* Prohibition and warning signs on the machine as well as the warnings in the operator's manual and in the instructions alsoapply to the service engineer.
* Comply with safety and warning instructions even when under time pressure.
* The service engineer has the function of a role model with respect to the customer and must act accordingly.
* When working on a machine with a customer or a second service engineer, ensure that you communicate clearly and make unambiguous arrangements.
Training course
* This service documentation is not intended for self-study. Participation in the corresponding product training course is required for service activities.
* All service engineers must attend an occupational safety training course for service engineers once a year.
If no safe alternative is available, the four-eyes principle must be applied before performing dangerous service activities.
Four-eyes principle for
dangerous activities
In doing so, the planned action steps must be checked and approved by another qualified person (e.g. in-house service engineer).
The information sheet on the four-eyes principle is part of the "Safety for service engineers" training and is available in SIS.

*Unsafe operation of the machine by the user (e.g. manipulated guards, missing exhaust system/dust extraction).*
*Risk of personal safety and health.*
* Refuse to carry out the assignment.
Malfunctions and errors

*Unforeseen malfunction.*
*Risk of injury due to undocumented dangers.*
* Estimate possible dangers before the service activity.
* Take appropriate safety precautions.
Temporary bypassing of
guards

*Temporary bypassing of guards.*
*Uncontrolled machine action.*
* Only put guards out of operation if the service operation cannot be performed otherwise.
* Make a note of all interventions in safety equipment before operation.
* Compensate for missing protective functions with additional measures.
* Restore and check protective function after end of operation.
Persons in the danger
All persons must be outside the machine's danger zone when drives are active. Wherever possible, perform troubleshooting and diagnostics from outside the danger zone (remote support).
If it is absolutely necessary to enter in the danger zone, observe the following warnings.

*Work in the danger zone.*
*Risk of injury*
* Switch off drives and secure them against being switched onagain (e.g. turn SAFETY-MODE key switch to position *1* andremove the key).

*Work in the danger zone when the drives are active.*
*Risk of injury.*
* Block drives by key switch (e.g., turn MOTOR CURRENT LIMIT key switch to position *1*).
* Block axis mechanically.

*Invisible laser radiation.*
*Risk of severe skin burns and damage to the eyes. Eyesight impairment or even blindness possible!*
* Secure the danger zone and shield off the laser area accordingly.
The customer's assistance is needed for some service work.
Customer assistance
The customer cannot be expected to operate the machine safely during service work.
Make sure the customer is outside the danger zone while service work is being performed.
* If possible, try not to rely on the customer's assistance.
* Do not encourage the customer to perform unauthorized activities.
* If necessary, request a second service engineer or request support from the In-house Sales / Service (remote support).
Obstructed view of the
machine
[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]
|image:img/image2.png[img/image2,width=192,height=33] a|

*Poor visibility of the danger zone.*
*Risk of injury.*
* When performing service work, make sure that no one insidethe danger zone.
* Cordon off a wide area around the automated system and the installation area to prevent unauthorized access.
Stepping on the roof of the machine/machine frame
[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]

*Step on the roof of the machine/machine frame.*
*Risk of Falling.*
* Do not step on the roof of the machine/machine frame.
Presence under
suspended loads

*Danger due to presence under suspended loads.*
*Physical injury or death.*
* Secure suspended loads by mechanical means, in addition to the motor brake.
Working on the electrical
cabinet or live parts
[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]
|image:img/image3.png[img/image3,width=192,height=33] a|

*Live parts*
*Risk of fatal injury*
* Only a trained electrician is allowed to work on live parts.
* Comply with the 5 safety rules for establishing and securing a voltage-free state in the working area for the duration of the work.
* Disconnect the unit from the power supply.
* Secure it against restarting.
* Ensure the absence of voltage.
* Ground it and short circuit the unit.
* Cover or separate all adjacent live components.
Additional equipment
provided by the customer
[width="100%",cols="35%,65%",options="header",]
|image:img/image3.png[img/image3,width=192,height=33] a|

*Danger due to use of damaged/unchecked additional equipment.*
*Physical injury or death.*
* Ensure that additional equipment provided by the customer is regularly checked and approved.
* Visually check additional equipment provided by the custom-er for damage before use.
* If in doubt, request the required additional equipment from TRUMPF or from an external supplier.
