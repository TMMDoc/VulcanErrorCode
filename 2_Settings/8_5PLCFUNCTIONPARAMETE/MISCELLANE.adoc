== _5.2.1 Oil Lub Cycle Time_ 

- This defines the interval of Oil lubrication cycle to be carried out in the machine before start of the program.
If this value is > 0, then the Oil cycle function will be activated in the PLC.

== _5.2.2 Grease Lub Cycle Time_

- This defines the interval of Grease lubrication cycle to be carried out in the machine before start of the program.
If this value is > 0, then the Grease cycle function will be activated in the PLC.
Note: if both Oil & Grease cycle time are > 0, then the Cycle program will be activated based on the maximum time of Oil & Grease lub cycle.

== _5.2.3 Chip Conveyor Time_ 

- This defines the maximum time of Chip conveyor motion.
If activated via external key, the Chip Conveyor will run for this defined time & stop.
If activated by the start of program, then after the completion of program, it will run for this time & stop.
If this value is > 0, then the Chip Conveyor function will be activated in the PLC.

== _5.2.4 Laser Cutting Head Type_

- Following are the list of Cutting Head Type supported in the PLC:
00 : No Head
01 : Precitec
02 : Procutter EG8030
03: Procutter2.0 EG8050
Select the appropriate head used in the machine and accordingly the PLC function will be activated.

== _5.2.5 Laser Type_

- Following are the list of Laser Type supported in the PLC:
00 : No Laser Source
01 : IPG_YLS Laser
02 : GSI Laser
03 : Rofin Laser
04 : IPG_YLM Laser
05 : IPG_YLR Laser
06 : nLight Laser
07 : Raycus Laser
08 : Trumpf Laser
09 : SPI Laser
Select the appropriate laser used in the machine and accordingly the PLC function will be activated.

== _5.2.6 Delay for stop button - Pause program_

- This defines the delay time of Stop button (1^st^ press) to pause the program. If the input exists more than this delay time, then the program is paused.

== _5.2.7 Delay for stop button - Abort program_

- This defines the delay time of Stop button (2^nd^ press) to abort the program. If the input exists more than this delay time, then the program is aborted.

== _5.2.8 Machine Origin Point Left, Right, Up, Down_


*-* This defines the origin point of the Machine with axis direction definition as follows:
0 : X-, X+ & Y+, Y-
1 : X-, X+ & Y-, Y+
2 : X+, X- & Y-, Y+
4 : X+, X- & Y+, Y-
8 : Y+, Y- & X+, X-
16 : Y+, Y- & X-, X+
32 : Y-, Y+ & X-, X+
64 : Y-, Y+ & X+, X-

== _5.2.9 Used to define the Jog keys_

- Following are the options of Jog Keys assignment:
0 : HMI keys – will use the HMI keys to jog the axis
1 : External Axis Sel & Jog keys – Axis selection & jog keys are used in Machine control panel
2 : External XY Jog keys – X+ X- / Y+ Y- key assignment
According to the above selection, the Jog key function is activated in the PLC.

== _5.2.10 Used to define the Override keys_

- Following are the options of Override Keys assignment:
0 : HMI – will use the HMI Override keys
1 : Rotary Switch (Gray Code) – Override values depends on the position of rotary switch
2 : Potentiometer – Override values depends on the potentiometer analogue input
3 : Encoder – Override values depends on the encoder position
4 : Buttons – Override - & Override +; buttons to change the override values
According to the above selection, the Override key function is activated in the PLC.
