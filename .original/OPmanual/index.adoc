* Before changing the material from aluminum/aluminum alloys to ferrous materials or vice versa, the storage bins and the loading area below the machine should always be cleaned.
* The machine control detects whether a critical material change occurs based on the specified material. A message requesting the emptying of the storage bins must be confirmed.
* The cutting operation must not be resumed until *all* the storage bins have been inserted into the machine. Operation of the system is only permitted with the storage bins inserted.

[#_Toc160546970 .anchor]####Test reportThe noise measurement report contains the measurements results for the component with the maximum noise level – the basic machine. The maximum values determined also apply for all variants of automated machines. On average, the contribution of the automation parts to the noise level for the loudest and the typical operating mode can be neglected.

*Note*

The testing was done on a technically comparable machine that is representative of the planned manufacturing process.

When the dust collector is purging , the measurement value of all measuring points will be 10-20dB higher than the normal measurement.At the end of the cutting, if the cutting gas passes through the cutting hole (whistle effect), the measured result will be about 7dB higher than the normal value.When cutting SS060MD0-N2H0-30-2 with EAU100 nozzle and 8bar pressure, the measurement result is approximately 5dB higher than normal. +
