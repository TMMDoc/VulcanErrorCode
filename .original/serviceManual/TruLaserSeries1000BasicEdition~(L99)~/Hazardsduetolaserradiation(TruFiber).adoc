= Hazards due to laser radiation (TruFiber)

Solid-state laser TruFiber
The TruFiber is a laser class 4 solid-state laser.
Solid-state lasers generate intensive light in the invisible near infrared spectral range with a wavelength of 900 to 1250nm.
Biological tissue absorbs light in different ways. It is usually converted into heat and causes thermal damage (e.g. burns, destruction of protein) and permanent retina damage.
Eyes and skin are especially at risk due to direct and reflective laser radiation.

*Invisible, high-energy laser radiation!*
*Risk of severe skin burns and damage to the eyes. Impairment or even loss of eyesight possible!*
* Only operate the machine with the guards active.
* Check the guards for damage daily.
* Observe warning signs and warning symbols.

*Incorrect laser safety glasses!*
*Serious eye injuries. Vision impairment and blindness.*
* Use laser safety glasses that are approved for the wavelength of the laser radiation of the laser.
