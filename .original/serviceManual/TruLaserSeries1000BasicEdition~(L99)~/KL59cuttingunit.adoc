== Luminous displays on the KL59 cutting unit

After switching on the machine or drives, the cutting unit is supplied with voltage. The drive in the cutting unit moves into the reference position.
LEDs on the adjustment
unit for the lens change
The LEDs on the housing show the status of the cutting unit.
The LEDs on the adjustment unit indicate the status of the cutting unit drive.
