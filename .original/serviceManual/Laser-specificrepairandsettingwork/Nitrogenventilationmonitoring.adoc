== Check the sealing gas pressure at the cutting unit KL59

For L99, sealing gas is only available from a laser power of 6 kW with KL59.

* The valve locks the nitrogen flow automatically if the pressur-e rises to > 5.5 bar.
* For L99, sealing gas is only available from a laser power of 6kW.
* Do not adjust the sealing gas pressure controller.
[arabic]
. Turn left-hand pressure valve to 0 bar (see the figure above).
. Open the bleed screw on the pressure shut-off valve.
* The pressure is bled from the system…
* The pressure shut-off valve opens automatically if the pressure drops to below 4 bar.
[arabic, start=3]
. Set the left-hand pressure control valve to 4.5 bar.
