== Description
G9 S0 cannot be shifted

== Cause

An attempt is made to move the zero point of the base coordinate system S0 by G92, although this was forbidden by machine constant MK_CFG_ENABLE_S0T0_OFFSET / MK_S0T0_VERSATZ_ERLAUBT.

== Action
 

 Correct the G92 call to use a different coordinate system, or enable MK_CFG_ENABLE_S0T0_OFFSET / MK_S0T0_VERSATZ_ERLAUBT..

== Effect
