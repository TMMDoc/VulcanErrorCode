== Description
G2 invalid target channel entry

== Cause

 In G22 (subroutine call), an impermissible NC channel was specified in parameter K. This can have several reasons:
 The controller is not enabled for the use of the specified channel
 MK_NC_MAX_CHANNELS / MK_KANALANZAHL is set to a too low value
 Necessary information for opening a new NC channel in the G22 call has been omitted

== Action
 
The solution depends on the cause.
 Only use NC channels that are enabled on your controllers. If the number of activated channels is not sufficient, please contact your sales consultant.
 Increase the MK_NC_MAX_CHANNELS / MK_KANALANZAHL
 When calling G22 with parameter K, always also specify a value for L and the axes to be transferred to the new channel

== Effect
