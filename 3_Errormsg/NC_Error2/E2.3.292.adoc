== Description
Too many axes addressed in one block

== Cause

In a DIN block, more than the maximum permitted number of simultaneously programmable axes (6) are addressed.

== Action
 

 Program a maximum of six axes in one geometry block.
 If the block that was specified in the additional information for the error is not a geometry block (e.g. subroutine call G22 with generation of a new NC channel and transfer of more than 6 axes), you can update the controller firmware to at least V2.65beta1. As of this version, the specification of more than six axes is supported in non-geometry blocks.

== Effect
