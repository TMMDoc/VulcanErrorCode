== Description
G23 The configured maximum deceleration of the virtual axis (E) 
exceeds the defined limit of the distance controlled axis

== Cause

The error occurs if the parameter E (virtual control) has been programmed at G231. The maximum delay of the virtual axis must not be higher than 80 % of the maximum delay of the height-controlled axis so that the controller has sufficient control reserve for the height control.

== Action
 

 Change the machine constant  so that the maximum delay of the virtual axis is at most 80 % of the maximum delay of the height-controlled axis.ExampleError message:
