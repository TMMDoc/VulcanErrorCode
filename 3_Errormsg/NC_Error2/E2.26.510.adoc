== Description
EtherCAT-Config: configured node not found

== Cause

This error message indicates an address conflict or a problem with the assignment of application axis numbers to EtherCAT nodes.Possible errors:
 The units of a multi-axis controller were assigned to an EtherCAT node in the machine constants with different address modes (e.g. unit 1 via topological address, unit 2 via explicit address).
 When assigning application axis numbers to the units of an EtherCAT node and addressing via explicit addresses, gaps were generated (e.g. addressing via explicit addresses and unit 1 does not get an application address, but unit 2 gets one)Possible solutionCheck entries in the machine constants MK_DRV_ETHERCAT_AXES / MK_ETHERCATDRIVES and MK_DRV_ETHERCAT_ADDRESSES/MK_ETHERCATADDRESSES.
